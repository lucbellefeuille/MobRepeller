# MobRepeller
MobRepeller is a lightweight Bukkit/Spigot 1.12.2 plugin that keeps your base peaceful in heavily-modded worlds. Players build small “Totems” that block natural hostile spawns in a radius and gently push hostiles outward. Support for modded mobs is built in. Simple. Server-friendly. New-player proof.
